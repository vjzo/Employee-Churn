# Employee-Churn



Using H.R data of a company to analyze and predict employee churn.

5 Exploratory data analyses are implmented to gain meaningful insights out and understand the prime features to be used for prediction.

SMOTE sampling technique is used to upsample the data. Using the sampled data, different machine learning algorithms have been implemented.

LR, Kernel SVM, RF and GB were all applied to the sampled data and the model performance was evaluated on AUC.

Parameter tuning was carried out.

This repository is based on the work of Randy Lao & Anirudh Panthula. I have modified and added EDA, Machine Learning Techniques, Feature Scaling and Parameter tuning.
